ROSTER.php file:

** Question #1:
  Why is the form-inline#2 (state and zipcode) butted up against the city field? How to fix it?

===============
UPDATE.php file:
===============

** Question #1:
 Why does the zip code data NOT show on the update form?
 It is always blank even though there is information in the database.
 It is being updated... (if user does NOT enter the correct zip code, the zipcode will be set to blank!)

** Question #2:
 Why does the UniformSize NOT update, even though it does show the information on the form?

** Question #3:
  Currently, clicking on the 'x' does nothing...
  How do I get it to close the modal, without saving the changes, and return to roster.php ?

** Question #4:
  Why is the form-inline#2 (state and zipcode) butted up against the city field? How to fix it?
