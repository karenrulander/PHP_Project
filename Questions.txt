** Question #1:
 Why does the UniformSize NOT update, even though it does show the information on the form?
(Comment-ted out the code to update the UniformSize field, since it will not update. More research is needed to determine the issue. )

** Question #2:
  Currently, clicking on the 'x' does nothing...
  How do I get it to close the modal, without saving the changes, and return to roster.php ?
