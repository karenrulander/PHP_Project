Things To Do When Time Allows:

Roster Page:
===========
1) Change listing of players from an ul to a table. Also list more information from the database.

2) Modify the 'Add A Player' button to show new fields added as a result of #1 above.

3) Modify the 'Edit Player' button to show new fields added as a result of #1 above.




Location Page:
==============
1) Add back and fix issue with the google api not displaying. (this has something to do with the localhost.) This was working before I moved it to MAMP.
Refer to the Terry repositories on github. This was my front-end class project.



Calendar Page:
==============
1) Change from HTML listing to the event table in the database. Provide add, edit, and delete functionality. (mimic the team roster logic.)



Database:
========

roster table:  Add a new field called 'id'. Make this the primary key instead of the jerseynumber.
              Change all relevant code.
